# Experimental Unity Game Design Project, originally created for Game Design I Semester Project (2021)

Sword Sprinter is a prototype infinite-runner game, built in Unity3D.  Players must defeat a series of enemies as quickly as possible, utilizing a direction-based attack system.  The player must learn the enemies' attack patterns  in order to counter attacks, all the while blocking blows to keep their HP from falling to 0.  But there's a twist!  As the player progresses, enemies will become more intelligent, learning the player's actions, predicting attacks, and adapting to throw the player off.

This is an early prototype of an experimental system for enemy AI in action-combat games, striving to make even basic enemies dynamic and unique in every encounter.
